Lucas C,D Polynomial Coefficients
=================================

Format
------
Base, "C", bunch of coefficients for C Poly, "D", bunch of coefficients for D Poly

eg.

10,C,1,5,7,5,1,D,1,2,2,1


Means:

base = 10 <br />
C Poly = x^4 + 5*x^3 + 7*x^2 + 5*x + 1 <br />
D Poly = x^3 + 2*x^2 + 2*x + 1 <br />
